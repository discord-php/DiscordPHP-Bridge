/**
 * How an {@see Action} presents itself as a Discord slash command.
 *
 * Slash commands need something prefix commands do not: a declared, typed
 * parameter list, so Discord can render a picker and reject bad input before
 * the bot ever sees it. Rather than describe every action twice, an action
 * opts in by attaching one of these, and {@see SlashAdapter} turns it into the
 * real thing — reusing the same handler, unchanged.
 *
 * Actions without a spec are still reachable by prefix in both chats; they
 * simply do not appear in Discord's command menu.
