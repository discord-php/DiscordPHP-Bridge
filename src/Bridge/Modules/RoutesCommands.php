/**
 * Registers a sub-command with the two checks every one of them needs.
 *
 * DiscordPHP already routes `/telegram link` to a handler registered as
 * `listenCommand(['telegram', 'link'])` and hands it that sub-command's own
 * options; what it does not do is decide who may run it. Both checks —
 * guild-only, and the permission gate — would otherwise be the first eight
 * lines of every handler in the bridge, which is exactly the kind of
 * repetition that eventually gets one of them wrong.
 *
 * Handlers are called as `(Interaction $interaction, Guild $guild,
 * ExCollectionInterface $options)`, and may declare only the leading
 * parameters they use.
