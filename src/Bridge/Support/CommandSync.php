/**
 * Decides whether the application command Discord already has still matches
 * the one this build defines.
 *
 * Without this, a bot that registers a command only when it is missing keeps
 * whatever it published the first time: add a sub-command, restart, and the
 * new one is routed in code but never offered by Discord — the handler simply
 * cannot be reached. Re-creating the command on every boot is not the answer
 * either, since a global command takes up to an hour to propagate and the
 * write is rate limited.
 *
 * So the two definitions are compared, and only a real difference is
 * published. The comparison has to be lenient about everything Discord adds on
 * its way back — `id`, `application_id`, `version`, defaults it fills in, and
 * key order — or every restart would look like a change.
