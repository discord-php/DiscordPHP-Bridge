/**
 * Turns the result of the startup check into something a human can act on.
 *
 * A bridge is a pair of ends that outlive the process, and either can stop
 * working while the bot is down: the Discord channel can be deleted, the bot
 * can be removed from the server, or the room on the other network can be
 * renamed, deleted or closed to it. None of that produces an error at startup —
 * it produces a bridge that quietly relays nothing, which is indistinguishable
 * from "nobody has said anything".
 *
 * So each restored bridge is probed once, and anything broken is named. Pure,
 * so the wording and the counting can be tested without a socket.
 *
 * Nothing is pruned automatically. A guild can be briefly unavailable during a
 * Discord outage, and deleting somebody's configuration because of a bad ten
 * seconds is far worse than logging a line they can act on.
