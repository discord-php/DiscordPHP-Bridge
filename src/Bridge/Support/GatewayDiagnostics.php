 * Turns a Discord gateway close code into something you can act on.

 * the record's *context*, which a log line that prints only the message throws
 * away. What is left says the bot stopped and nothing about why — and the two
 * most common causes have completely different fixes that look identical from
 * the outside: the bot connects, identifies, and is dropped a second later.
 *
 * Every string here names the specific thing to change, because "authentication
 * failed" sends people to re-copy a token that was never the problem.
