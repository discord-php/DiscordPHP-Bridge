/**
 * Remembers which message on one network became which message on the other,

 *
 * Bounded and in memory on purpose. An edit almost always follows within
 * minutes of the message, so the useful window is short; persisting it would
 * mean a growing file of ids that stop existing, and keeping it unbounded
 * would mean a bridge that slowly eats the host's memory for a feature nobody
 * uses on a week-old message. When an entry has been evicted — or the process
 * restarted — the bridge falls back to relaying the edit as a new message,
 * which is worse than editing in place but better than dropping it.
